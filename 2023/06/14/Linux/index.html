<p> Linux is an open-source operating system kernel initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It is the core component of various Linux distributions, which are complete operating systems built around the Linux kernel. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, and it has become one of the most popular operating systems, particularly in the realm of servers and embedded systems.</p>
<p> Linux is based on the Unix operating system, and it shares many of its design principles and features, such as multitasking, multi-user support, and a hierarchical file system. However, unlike Unix, Linux is open-source, which means its source code is freely available and can be modified and distributed by anyone.</p>
<p> One of the key advantages of Linux is its modularity and versatility. It can run on a wide range of hardware platforms, from small embedded devices to powerful servers. Linux also supports a vast array of software applications, thanks to its large and active open-source community. Many popular software tools, servers, and programming languages have versions specifically designed for Linux.</p>
<p> Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and CentOS, package the Linux kernel with additional software, including desktop environments, utilities, and application software, to provide a complete user-friendly operating system. Each distribution may have its own unique features, package management systems, and software repositories.</p>
<p> Linux has gained popularity among developers, system administrators, and enthusiasts due to its flexibility, customizability, and extensive command-line interface. It is widely used for web servers, database servers, networking equipment, supercomputers, and many other applications. Additionally, Linux has been the foundation for other open-source projects, such as Android, which is the most widely used mobile operating system globally.</p>

<li>In our machine we don not always like to use a Linux system, so for that we can install <strong>VirtualBox</strong> from oracle to simulate a Linux system.</li>
<li>Once it’s downloaded enable <strong>Virtualization</strong> of the pc, you can check it in the Task Manager, to see if it is enabled.</li>
