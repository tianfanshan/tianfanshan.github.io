<h3 id="lombok"><a href="#lombok" class="headerlink" title="lombok"></a>lombok</h3><p><strong>@Data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It makes us no longer need to create getter, setter, toString and other methods.<br><strong>@AllArgsConstructor</strong></li>
<li>Create all arguments constructor for us.<br><strong>@NoArgsConstructor</strong></li>
<li>Create non argument constructor for us.<br><strong>@Getter</strong></li>
<li>Create getter method for every field we have in the class.<br><strong>@Setter</strong></li>
<li>Create setter method for every field we have in the class.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jakarta-persistence"><a href="#jakarta-persistence" class="headerlink" title="jakarta.persistence"></a>jakarta.persistence</h3><p><strong>@Entity and @Id</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If they are not in a java class then this class is completely a typical POJO java class. Now after adding these two annotations, it can be used as an entity class corresponding to the   table in the database.<br><strong>@Table</strong></li>
<li>It is an optional annotation, use @Table(name &#x3D; ?) to specify the mapping table name for the entity. If @Entity(name &#x3D; ?) and @Table(name &#x3D; ?) are used at the same time, the final corresponding table name depends on the @Table annotation, because it has higher priority.<br><strong>@GeneratedValue</strong></li>
<li>In JPA, the significance of the @GeneratedValue annotation is to generate a uniquely identified primary key for an entity, JPA requires that each Entity must have and only have one primary key, it privades the generation of the primary key strategy. It has 2 attributes: strategy and generator. Where the value of the generator attribute is a string, it declares the name of the primary key generator. JPA provides developers with four primery key generation strategies, we can add them by using strategy along: GenerationType.TABLE, GenerationType.SEQUENCE, GenerationType.IDENTITY and GenerationType.AUTO.<br><strong>@OneToOne</strong></li>
<li>We can add it on two corresponding entities fields to implement a one-to-one relationship in the database.<br><strong>@OneToMany</strong> and <strong>@ManyToOne</strong></li>
<li>To implement many-to-one and one-to-many relationship between two entities by adding these annotations on the corresponding field.<br><strong>@ManyToMany</strong></li>
<li>To implement many-to-many relationship between two entities.<br><strong>@JoinTable</strong></li>
<li>Use it to create a join table, also known as an “intermediate table”. It usually used for many-to-many and unidirectional one-to-many association mappings.<br><strong>@JoinColumn</strong></li>
<li>Since annotations such as @OneToOne, @OneToMany, @ManyToOne and @ManyToMany can only determine the relationship between entities, the cannot specifiy the associated fields int hte database thable corresponding to the entity, so they need to be used in conjunction with the @JoinColumn annotation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="org-springframework-web-bind-annotation"><a href="#org-springframework-web-bind-annotation" class="headerlink" title="org.springframework.web.bind.annotation"></a>org.springframework.web.bind.annotation</h3><p><strong>@RestController</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is a new annotation after Spring4, it contains @Controller and @ResponseBody. It allows us to return a response as type JSON to the client.<br><strong>@RequestMapping</strong></li>
<li>We can use this annotation aboce the class, to map the http request to the controller, and specify the preliminary request mapping address, which is equivalent to the parent path of the request address.<br><strong>@PostMapping</strong>[@RequestMapping(method &#x3D; RequestMethod.POST)],<br><strong>@PutMapping</strong>[@RequestMapping(method &#x3D; RequestMethod.PUT)],<br><strong>@RequestBody</strong>[Generally, it is used to transfer data of JSON type from the client],<br><strong>@RequestParam</strong>[the function is to pass the parameter of the specified name in the request to the formal parameter assignment in the controller]</li>
<li>By using these above mapping annotations allow us to provide requestBody and requestParameter from the client, and we can use those data to manipulate database(we also can use <strong>@PathVariable</strong> here).<br><strong>@GetMapping</strong>[@RequestMapping(method &#x3D; RequestMethod.GET)],<br><strong>@DeleteMapping</strong>[@RequestMapping(method &#x3D; RequestMethod.DELETE)],<br><strong>@PathVariable</strong>[placeholder parameters in the URL can be bound to the input parameters of the controller processing method]</li>
<li>Use those annotations to manipulate the get and delete request from the client with the parameter fetched where the client passed in the url by using <strong>@PathVariable</strong>.<br><strong>@ControllerAdvice</strong></li>
<li>It is a new annotation in Spring3.2, it’s role is to add unified operations or processing to another controllers, something like AOP programming. We usually use it with the following three annotations.<br><strong>@ExceptionHandler</strong></li>
<li>Global exception handing: it is used to capture the specified type of exception thrown in the Controller, so as to achieve the purpose of different types of exception handing.<br><strong>@InitBinder</strong></li>
<li>Gloval data preprocessing: it is used to register the custom parameter parsing method in the request, so as to achieve the purpose of customizing the specified format parameters.<br><strong>@ModelAttribute</strong></li>
<li>Gloval data binding: it means that the annotated method will be executed before the target Controller method is executed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jakarta-validation-constraints"><a href="#jakarta-validation-constraints" class="headerlink" title="jakarta.validation.constraints"></a>jakarta.validation.constraints</h3><p><strong>@NotEmpty</strong><br>The field of type String, Collection, Map and Array with @NotEmpty added cannot be null or have a length of 0. It works like the functionality of the isEmpty() method.<br><strong>@NotNull</strong><br>If the parameter passed by the method is null, a null pointer exception will be thrown. Therefore using the @NotNull annotation can ensure the correctness of the code and improve the readability of the code.<br><strong>@NotBlank</strong><br>Can only act on a String filed, can not be null, and after calling trim(), the length must be greater than 0.<br><strong>@Email</strong><br>This annotation is used to verify that the email attribute contains a valid email address. If the string contained in the email property is not a valid email address before saving the entity, an exception will be thrown and the save operation will be blocked.<br><strong>@Size</strong><br>It’s used to validate the size of a field in a Java Bean, such as a string, collection, or array. The @Size annotation takes two parameters: “min” and “max”, which define the minimum and maximum size of the field.<br><strong>@Max</strong><br>It’s used to validate that a field in a Java Bean is less than or equal to a maximum value. It takes a single parameter, which is the maximum value allowed for the field.<br><strong>@Min</strong><br>It’s used to validate that a field in a Java Bean is less than or euqal to a minimum value. It takes a single parameter, which is the minimum value allowed for the field.<br><strong>@Pattern</strong><br>It in Spring Boot is used to validate if a string matches a specified regular expression. It is typically used on entity class fields to restrict the range of values that can be assigned to the field.</p>
<h3 id="jakarta-validation"><a href="#jakarta-validation" class="headerlink" title="jakarta.validation"></a>jakarta.validation</h3><p><strong>@Valid</strong><br>It in Spring Boot is used to trigger the validation of a nested object during data binding. When a controller method receives an object as a parameter, Spring Boot will attempt to bind the incoming request data to that object using data binding. If the object contains nested objects, the “@Valid” annotation can be used to trigger validation on those nested objects as well.</p>
<h3 id="org-springframework-security-access-prepost"><a href="#org-springframework-security-access-prepost" class="headerlink" title="org.springframework.security.access.prepost"></a>org.springframework.security.access.prepost</h3><p><strong>@PreAuthorize</strong><br>It in Spring Boot is to used to specify that a method should only be executed if the user has the required permissions. It is typically used in combination with Spring Security to add access control to an application.<br>It can be placed on a method or on the class level. If it is placed on a class, it will apply to all methods in that class. The annotation takes a <strong>Spring Expression Language</strong> expression as its parameter. The expression is evaluated to determine if the user has the necessary permissions to execute the method.</p>
<h3 id="org-springframework-beans-factory-annotation"><a href="#org-springframework-beans-factory-annotation" class="headerlink" title="org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation"></a>org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation</h3><p><strong>@Value</strong><br>It in Spring Boot is used to inject a value from a property file or an environment variable into a Spring Bean. It can be used to inject values of various types including String, primitive types, and complex objects.<br>To use the @Value annotation, it must be placed on the field or constructor parameter to be injected, and the value to be injected must be specified using the Spring Expression Language syntax.</p>
<h3 id="org-springframework-stereotype"><a href="#org-springframework-stereotype" class="headerlink" title="org.springframework.stereotype"></a>org.springframework.stereotype</h3><p><strong>@Component</strong><br>It in Spring Boot is used to mark a class as a Spring-managed component. It is a general-purpose annotation that can be used to indicate that a class is a Spring Bean and should be managed by the Spring Inversion of Control container.<br>By default, Spring Boot will scan for classes annotated with @Component(as well as other stereotype annotations like @Service, @Repository and @Controller) and automatically create and configure an instance of the class as a Bean in the application context.<br><strong>@Service</strong><br>It in Spring Boot is used to indicate that a class is a Spring-managed service component. It is a specialization of the @Component annotation and is used to provide a clear and concise way to distinguish a service component from other types of components such as controller, repository, or configuration classes.<br>The @Service annotation is typically used to mark classes that contain business logic or service layer functionality.</p>
<h3 id="org-springframework-context-annotation"><a href="#org-springframework-context-annotation" class="headerlink" title="org.springframework.context.annotation"></a>org.springframework.context.annotation</h3><p><strong>@Bean</strong><br>It in Spring Boot is used to declare a method that instantiates, configures, and initializes a new object as a Spring-managed bean. It is typically used in configuration classes to specify the beans that should be created and managed by the Spring IoC container.<br>When a method is annotated with @Bean, is it called by the Spring container and the object returned by the method is registered as a bean in the application context. The bean name is derived from the method name by default, but it can be ocerriden using the “name” attribute of the @Bean annotation.<br><strong>@Configuration</strong><br>This annotation in Spring Boot is used to indicate that a class is a configuration class. Configuration classes provide bean definitions for the Spring IoC container, which are used to create and manage objects in the application context.<br>The @Configuration annotation is often used in conjunction with @Bean annotations to specify the objects that should be created and managed by the Spring container.</p>
<h3 id="org-springframework-security-config-annotation-method-configuration"><a href="#org-springframework-security-config-annotation-method-configuration" class="headerlink" title="org.springframework.security.config.annotation.method.configuration"></a>org.springframework.security.config.annotation.method.configuration</h3><p><strong>@EnableMethodSecurity</strong><br>When this annotation is used, Spring Security will intercept method calls and apply access control to them based on the specified security configuration. This allows you to secure individual methods and ensure that only authorized users can call them.<br>To use @EnableMethodSecurity, you need to have a configuration class that extends GlobalMethodSecurityConfiguration or implements MethodSecurityConfigurer. This class provides the security configuration that defines the access control rules for each method.</p>
<h3 id="org-springframework-boot-autoconfigure"><a href="#org-springframework-boot-autoconfigure" class="headerlink" title="org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure"></a>org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure</h3><p><strong>@SpringBootApplication</strong><br>This annotation is a meta-annotation in Spring that combines several other annotations to provide a convenient way to bootstrap a Spring application. It is typically used on the main class of a Spring Boot application.<br>When @SpringBootApplication is used, it enables the following annotations:<br>@Configuration: Indicates that the class declares one or more @Bean methods and may be processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans.<br>@EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to automatically configure the application based on its classpath and other settings. This can save a lot of boilerplate configuration code.<br>@ComponentScan: Instructs Spring to scan the specified packages for components, such as controllers, services, and repositories, and add them to the Spring context.<br>By combining these three annotations, @SpringBootApplication provides a convenient way to configure and bootstrap a Spring application with sensible defaults, without having to write a lot of boilerplate code.</p>
